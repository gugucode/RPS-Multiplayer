# RPS-Multiplayer
Rock Paper Scissors


In this project, we build a Rock Paper Scissors game. Our program will pair up two players and tell the player who is avaiable if his/her oppenent is offline and someone is waiting at the same time. Players can send message to each other, but all previous messages will be remove if player has new oppenent.

## More:
1.	Since this is a simple gaming application, I used the auto clear up API from Firebase to remove player’s information when player leaves the game (like refresh page or close browser).
2.	The most difficult part of this project is when/where to place a Firebase database call to let it automatically update players’ info and alert other player.  After some logical analysis of the game and many testing, I could correctly combine the Firebase API calls and JavaScript codes and made perfectly work together. 
4.	Refactoring code and adding new functions are still keep and going.
